INTERACTIVE FICTION BASIC ENGINE
================================
README / VERSION 0.9 / 5.12.2021
--------------------------------

Engine requies two files:
- save.dat
- script.dat

In the <save.dat> file there needs to be two lines representing scene number 
and player life.

Most important file is <script.dat> that holds the whole story.
