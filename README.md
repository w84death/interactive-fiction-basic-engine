![Cover image](signal-2021-06-26-223143.jpeg)
Made on MS DOS 5.5 in QuickBASIC 4.5

More about my [developer DOS setup here](https://bits.p1x.in/using-ms-dos-and-wordstar-in-2021/).

My game engine for text-based games. It uses super simple script language for the gameplay logic.

## ChangeLog

- 2.0 -> 4.0 - refctors, proper sound handling, menu
- 5-0 - intro w/ 3D model, word-wrapping
- 6.0 - optimalizations, color palette

## Planned

- 7.0 - refactor draw window
- 8.0 - window effects
